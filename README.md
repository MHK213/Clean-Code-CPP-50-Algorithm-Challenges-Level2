# 🚀 C++ Problem Solving – Level 02

This repository contains solutions to Level 02 programming problems designed to strengthen your fundamental skills in C++. Each problem focuses on key logic-building techniques, control flow mastery, and understanding the behavior of common built-in functions by recreating them manually.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Strengthen understanding of core programming concepts.  
- Practice solving real-world-like problems using basic constructs.  
- Re-implement built-in C++ functions from scratch to understand inner workings.  
- **Learn reusability** by breaking logic into reusable helper functions.  
- Improve code organization and problem decomposition skills.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside

- Reimplementation of functions like `abs()`, `round()`, `ceil()`, `floor()`, and `sqrt()`.
- Array manipulation: copying, filtering, searching, and counting.
- Logic-based utilities such as checking for palindromes, primes, evens/odds.
- Random number generation and structured input/output.
