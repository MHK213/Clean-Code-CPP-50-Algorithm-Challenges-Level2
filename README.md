# 🚀 C++ Problem Solving – Level 02

This repository contains solutions to programming problems I solved while taking the Algorithms and Problem Solving Level 2 course. The problems helped me develop my basic C++ skills. Each problem focuses on basic logic construction techniques and understanding the behavior of common built-in functions by manually recreating them.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Strengthen understanding of core programming concepts.   
- Re-implement built-in C++ functions from scratch to understand inner workings.  
- **Learn reusability** by breaking logic into reusable helper functions.  
- Improve code organization and problem decomposition skills.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside

- Reimplementation of functions like `abs()`, `round()`, `ceil()`, `floor()`, and `sqrt()`.
- Array manipulation: copying, filtering, searching, and counting.
- Logic-based utilities such as checking for palindromes, primes, evens/odds.
- Random number generation and structured input/output.
